# BottleHub Official

This is the official repository for everything BottleHub.

## What's BottleHub?

It is a Web 3 casino designed for freedom and decentralisation in gambling, while providing an efficient token which preserves the value of your money.

### Safety First

Providing a safer financing system for gambling and a better virtual casino experience, we aim to create a platform where users can control their own data and keep their identity safe.

### Freedom

We at the team value your freedom, that's why we are creating a system where you can extend the power of the hub through free to use APIs as well as plugin support.

### Community Powered

Aiming to build a friendly ecosystem isn't possible without a healthy community. We've included a safe social feature we hope you'll enjoy, no telementary, only user controlled encryptions and privacy first chatboards. We have no way of controlling your data. It works and we love it.
